# marvin
A chronically depressed and often bored robot that performs mundane tasks, despite being capable of great things. 

Marvin is a home automation platform that runs on a Raspberry Pi. It makes use of WebIOPi and other tools to provide an interface for controlling hardware devices. Currently, the only supported hardware is a set of remote controlled light switches that have been hacked to connect to the RPi. However, easier hardware integration and support is planned for a future version.
